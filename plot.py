# Introduction

The function plot(...) defined below is called by BLELog to display a live
graph of the data received.

You *will* have to update this file and adjust the plots to fit the data
you are receiving and wanting to display.

# Overview

The plot function does the following:

    - Set up a matplotlib plot
    - Set up some deques to hold the most recent data
    - Set up a matplotlib plot
    - define the function 'animate', which gets called by
      matplotlib repeatedly to update the plot

animate(_) in turn does the following:

    - Get data from the input data_queue, and send it to the correct deque
    - Clear the plot
    - Re-draw the plot with the most recent data.

Data arrives via the process-safe and thread-safe queue 'data_queue' in the
form of NotifData objects:

    @dataclass
    class NotifData:
        device_adr: str                  # Bluetooth address
        device_name_repr: str            # Alias, Device Name, or address
        characteristic: Characteristic   # The characteristic that received this
                                         # data (as defined in config.py)
        data: List[List[Any]]            # The output of the decoder function
                                         # (as defined in char_decoders.py and
                                         # set in config.py)
        data_raw: bytearray              # Raw received data

# Important Notes

Multi-threading in python is a whole can of worms.
(See 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock')

Matplotlib cannot run in any thread but the main one - and even
if it could, the GIL-related limitations of python would likely cause
it to interfere with reliable data reception.

To get around this, BLELog runs this function (and hence matplotlib) in
a *completely separate* python interpreter. This means that this function
*cannot* directly access any of the internal state of BLELog.

It's only means of communication are:

    - data_queue: A process- and thread-safe queue where data arrives.

    - getLogger('log'): A logger that can be used for debug output - It too
      gets re-routed back to the main BLELog process using a queue.

This keeps things separate, allows matplotlib to run in its own process,
and avoids it from interfering with data logging.
